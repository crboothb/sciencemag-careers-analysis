# “Don’t tell me what to do!”: A full-text analysis of Science Careers in a changing academic job market

## Abstract
Science is one of the top interdisciplinary peer-reviewed journals, with a readership consisting primarily of academic scientists and since 1996 has been able to dedicate a section of its website, Science Careers, to career news and advice tailored towards early career researchers. As Science Careers has been active (1996-present), the academic job market has been transforming, most notably by a decrease in the availability of tenure-track academic posts for recent PhDs and postdocs. Using a dataset of 6,111 full-text Science Careers articles, compiled through web scraping, we perform an exploratory text analysis to characterize the changes in framing, topics, and scope of career content as the academic job market tightens. By faceting the career content into the “Advice,” “Career-related Policy,” and “Working life” categories that Science defines, we track the relative prominence of articles that explicitly present advice to the reader, as opposed to the more descriptive articles about workforce dynamics or personal experiences of career scientists. We find that, although the number of articles tagged “Advice” had remained consistently high from the inception of the Science Careers section, 2015 marked the beginning of a significant decrease in the number of prescriptive advice articles. [Furthermore, text and topic analyses reflect changes in discourse surrounding work outside academia, but decreases in the use of second-person imperative mood.] The apparent disinclination for strongly prescriptive advice may indicate a growing sense, even within an academic oriented venue, that career-pathways for researchers have become less predictable, making dispensing broadly applicable advice more challenging.
