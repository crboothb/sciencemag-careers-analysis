The Waiting Place.\u201d Little did I know it, but after I emerged from the \u201cweirdish wild space\u201d of graduate school, The Waiting Place was exactly where I was headed. I had accepted a postdoc position to develop new skills while embarking on what I anticipated would be a quick, productive search for an industry job. Instead that search dragged on, filled with false hopes and disappointments. I often felt I was going nowhere. But now that I\u2019ve passed the 1-year mark in my first position outside of academia, I can look back and say that I learned a valuable skill: the ability to wait actively. Here are three strategies I found most helpful.", " As a freshly minted Ph.D., I had plenty of material for my resume, but I wasn\u2019t sure how to pitch my skills to potential employers. To address this, I sought out a career coach who specialized in helping people with Ph.D.s in science and engineering. Hiring a professional consultant wasn\u2019t cheap, but I viewed it as an investment in another valuable skill: marketing myself. His guidance not only improved my resumes, but also gave me a better general understanding of how to present myself in meetings with recruiters and in interviews. I also took advantage of many free opportunities for career advice, including university-sponsored career forums, skills assessments with an on-campus career counselor, and numerous online resources for job seekers.", " At first, I felt that I didn\u2019t know \u201cthe right people\u201d to help me get a job, especially because I was looking for an industry position and my contacts were mostly in the academic world. However, once I started to look, I was surprised to realize how many second-degree connections\u2014friends of friends\u2014I actually had in industry. I reached out to many of them and asked to talk about their work. I also asked friends and colleagues for introductions to people in their networks. And I found ways to meet people outside my niche research area, for example by attending presentations by startup companies, meetings of technology interest groups, and on-campus socials.", "As a freshly minted Ph.D. ... I wasn\u2019t sure how to pitch my skills to potential employers.", "It sometimes felt awkward to put myself out there, but networking helped me learn about many companies and industries. It also led to job interviews, including with a Silicon Valley tech giant, a premier children\u2019s hospital, and a highly ranked liberal arts college.

During my first year as a postdoc, I applied for an opportunity I found on an online job board. This led to a promising email exchange, and I had a very positive interaction with one of the company\u2019s researchers at a conference. Unfortunately, the opportunity fell through. Another long year passed. I followed up with the company once or twice, but mostly I pursued other leads. Then, out of the blue, the researcher I had met contacted me about a new opening.

In her program, though not formally codified in writing, bringing noshes for one\u2019s committee meetings had become such an entrenched tradition that it was essentially expected. No student would have been censured for failure to feed the committee, but tenured eyebrows would certainly raise.", "\u201cIt\u2019s been kind of incredible,\u201d Bredbenner told me of the response she received following the publication of her essay. Before it went to press, she\u2019d viewed it as \u201ca very silly piece about not knowing how to make coffee.\u201d But afterward, she received an avalanche of personal emails\u2014from students and even faculty members\u2014thanking her for raising an issue that was apparently causing trouble at their schools as well.", "\u201cNow that I am on the other side of these committee meetings, I have also been perplexed by the food spreads students feel compelled to bring and have specifically said that they were not necessary,\u201d one professor wrote to her. \u201cThe tradition seems to live as a sort of ritual, though.\u201d", "In the months since, a number of graduate programs\u2014including the psychology department at the University of California (UC), Los Angeles; the biology and biomedical program at Vanderbilt University; and the molecular and cell biology department at UC Berkeley\u2014have actually changed their policies on committee meetings, making it officially clear that grad students, already used to catering ", " their committees, would no longer be expected to cater ", " their committees in the form of coffee and snacks. It\u2019s a policy reversal of a speed rarely seen in academia, where typically nothing changes without the formation of an exploratory committee, the dissolution of said committee due to infighting, a dean\u2019s fiat, an amendment that fails to pass, a poorly written editorial in the university newspaper, and finally a grudging acceptance of the new policy following threats from a donor.", "On its surface, bringing snacks may seem like an innocuous part of an annual progress review\u2014like booking a room, setting up chairs, or wearing underpants. At least, that was my initial reaction. I cook for my kids pretty much every day, so what\u2019s the big deal about cooking for a few adults? At least the adults won\u2019t reject the food and demand peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.", "But this small act\u2019s implications are significant. First, there\u2019s the financial burden, especially as the snack arms race escalated at some schools from home-baked banana bread to extra-fancy croissants on a platter from a locally renowned patisserie. With grad student stipends ranging from low to insultingly low, a platter of goodies can be an unwelcome extravagance. One student, replying to Bredbenner on Twitter, recounted buying a box of cookies at a food bank, then accidentally forgetting to remove the 25-cent sticker before serving them.", "Second, as Bredbenner pointed out, if you\u2019re already stressed about your actual science, who needs the added burden of picking up pastries or setting up a coffeemaker? Imagine it\u2019s the morning of your committee meeting, and a last-minute change forces you to reorder your PowerPoint slides\u2014but no time for that! You need to arrange muffins in an aesthetically pleasing manner!", "Perhaps most importantly, the practice just felt icky. It reinforced the concept of grad students as peons in an academic fiefdom who must literally serve the professors who can afford their own breakfast. I\u2019ve known heads of companies who have asked employees to walk their dogs; get their car washed; or, in one case, print place settings for their son\u2019s wedding. Should professors expect that kind of personal service, too?", "The requirements for advancement and ultimately graduation are already shrouded in mystery, and your committee decides\u2014often with an enigmatic and seemingly arbitrary justification\u2014when you\u2019re allowed to leave and begin your career. These people own your future, so you want them to feel as generous toward you as possible. That\u2019s why, as Bredbenner told me, catering her meetings always felt \u201coffering-like.\u201d", "\u201cStudents feel that professors can pretty much do whatever they want without repercussions,\u201d one student wrote in an email to Bredbenner. \u201cSo we must do everything possible to make sure they are on our side.\u201d", "I asked one of my grad school friends, now an assistant professor of chemistry, whether the food his students bring him influences his decisions in any way.

In 2007, a ", " at California State University in Northridge showed that professors who provide chocolate to students filling out course evaluations can expect higher ratings than those who don\u2019t.

Aging is by far the biggest risk factor for developing Alzheimer\u2019s\u2014if everyone lived to be 85, one in two people would develop dementia. The lion\u2019s share of Alzheimer\u2019s research and drug discovery to date has focused on misfolded amyloid and tau proteins, which aggregate to form plaques (amyloid) and tangles (tau) in the brain. But the body\u2019s attempt to clear the sticky proteins might also be contributing to or causing the neurodegeneration. Drug trials have almost exclusively sought to use antibodies targeted toward these two proteins to try to attack and clear the misfolded forms or mop up soluble forms, or to inhibit enzymes responsible for generating the miscreant peptides.", ", global head of neuroscience for Novartis in Cambridge, Massachusetts, paints a rosier view of the field\u2019s failures as representing big leaps in understanding Alzheimer\u2019s. \u201cWe\u2019ve learned a lot from the trials, and our capacity to measure disease progress is getting much better,\u201d he says. \u201cThere are a lot of really exciting experiments to do now.\u201d", "Because those experiments run the gamut from nearly every imaginable corner of biomedical science, researchers with any biology or clinical background, or even training in engineering and computational science, can find a way to move into Alzheimer\u2019s work. Expertise in neuroscience and protein folding alone are no longer ideal, or even absolutely required.", "\u201cIt\u2019s very exciting in terms of careers, because we need people doing biochemical analysis and mass spectroscopy, geneticists, cell biologists, pathologists, and those running animal studies,\u201d says ", ", director of University of Southern California\u2019s Alzheimer\u2019s Therapeutic Research Institute (ATRI) in San Diego.", "At the Alzheimer\u2019s Drug Discovery Foundation (ADDF), a nonprofit charity based in New York City, diversity is reflected in the research projects being funded there. \u201cWe\u2019re really seeing every type of different approach to Alzheimer\u2019s disease and related dementias,\u201d says ", ", director of scientific affairs at ADDF.

Researchers investigating proteostasis would like to find ways to boost the cell\u2019s \u201cgarbage disposal\u201d systems, which identify misfolded, clumping proteins and chew them up for recycling.", "Like other companies, Novartis is exploring targets in inflammation and the immune system. Dolmetsch notes that the field has just begun to sort through all of the activated inflammatory cells that show up in Alzheimer\u2019s patients\u2019 brains and to characterize their various states of activity and exhaustion. Exhausted microglia, the custodians of the brain, for example, start pumping out cytokines to call up more cells (T cells, B cells, macrophages), which leads to chronic inflammation.", "Such an inflammation might be fine for a temporary response to an injury in, say, the finger. But as a chronic state, \u201cit doesn\u2019t work so well in your brain,\u201d Dolmetsch says. For neuroinflammation projects, Novartis looks for scientists who have training with overlaps between neuroscience, immunology, and bioinformatics.", "The George & Anne Ryan Institute for Neuroscience at the University of Rhode Island in Kingston investigates underexplored factors in brain health, including the roles of vasculature, immunology, and neuroinflammation as well as lifestyle and environment in Alzheimer\u2019s disease and other neurodegenerative disorders.

Radioactive positron emission tomography (PET) tracers enable physicians to image and measure amyloid and tau proteins in the brains of living patients. Other biomarkers can be measured precisely from collecting cerebral spinal fluid. However, both types of tests are invasive, and PET scans are expensive.\u00a0", "\u201cWe need a blood test like [the one] we have for cholesterol that can be done in any doctor\u2019s office quickly and inexpensively,\u201d says Friedman. To spur such development, ADDF has teamed up with Bill Gates and other philanthropists to fund the Diagnostics Accelerator program. Friedman says the program anticipates awarding about $10 million in the first round of funding. So far it has funded projects for blood tests and tests that detect amyloid or vascular changes in the retina, and is reviewing applications for digital tests that use a smartphone or tablet to monitor disease signs or symptoms.", "Dedicated Alzheimer\u2019s research funding levels have never been higher. \u201cThere has been a dramatic boost in funding during the last few years,\u201d says ", ", chief of the Dementias of Aging Branch of the National Institute on Aging (NIA) in Bethesda, Maryland, adding that the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) funding specifically for Alzheimer\u2019s and related dementias research has blossomed from around USD 440 million in 2011 to USD 2.3 billion this year.", "In 2012, the United States launched the National Plan to Address Alzheimer\u2019s Disease and set a goal of treating and preventing Alzheimer\u2019s and related dementias by 2025. In support of the National Plan, NIH developed a research framework to enable the development of therapies for individuals at all stages of the disease. ", ", director of the Office for Strategic Development and Partnerships in NIA\u2019s Division of Neuroscience, says the increased funding and new framework bring many opportunities for Alzheimer\u2019s researchers in both academia and small businesses\u2014ranging from basic, discovery research to all stages of therapy development.", "One of those opportunities, the Accelerating Medicines Partnership Alzheimer\u2019s Disease Project, or (AMP)-AD, is a public\u2013private partnership that brings together six NIA-funded academic teams, four biopharmaceutical companies, and five nonprofit organizations.

Grant awardees, who receive up to USD 600,000 for two years, will be connected to industry consultants to help shepherd their research through drug discovery and preclinical phases to develop potential therapies.\u00a0", "Another innovative NIA translational program, the Alzheimer\u2019s Clinical Trials Consortium (ACTC), was launched in 2017 with nearly USD 70 million in support for five years, to accelerate studies of Alzheimer\u2019s and related dementia therapies. The ACTC helps researchers with new therapeutics connect to leading Alzheimer\u2019s clinical experts at 35 sites around the United States. The program solicits ideas first, and then, for those approved, collaboratively develops those ideas into a clinical trial NIA R01 grant application.\u00a0", "This effort also promotes open science with data-sharing requirements. For pivotal clinical trials, participants in the consortium are required to make their patient screening and prerandomization data available within 12 months of enrollment completion and to make their postrandomization data and biosamples available upon trial completion, regulatory approval, or within 18 months, whichever comes first. Making the data available not only honors trial participants, says Ryan, but gives the field much-needed information to solve an incredibly complex problem. \u201cIt\u2019s a heterogeneous disease and we need as many eyes on the data and as many minds focused on solving the problem as possible.\u201d", "Pharmaceutical company Eisai brought Aricept, one of the first Alzheimer\u2019s drugs, to market; Eisai also has two anti-amyloid compounds in Phase III clinical trials and is investing in more research as well. In July, Eisai opened the Center for Genetics Guided Dementia Discovery, dedicated to exploratory immunodementia research. The facility, located in Cambridge, Massachusetts, will host 130 employees, including new hires, interns, and postdocs, and an incubator for Cambridge-based startup companies in neuroscience therapeutics.", "McDade notes that there\u2019s a shortage of people with M.D./Ph.D.s who have the medical training necessary to do clinical research, run clinical trials, and develop appropriate diagnostic tests. He encourages any early-career researchers with an interest in the field to find collaborators. \u201cIt\u2019s extremely bullish\u2014this is the time to come into the field.\u201d", "With the emergence of so many new avenues of Alzheimer\u2019s studies, researchers can come from a wide variety of biomedical backgrounds, experts say. ", ", vice president of neuroscience development at the biopharmaceutical firm AbbVie in North Chicago, Illinois, notes that his company and others working on solutions for Alzheimer\u2019s want to recruit from biology backgrounds in molecular genetics, systems biology, electrophysiology, cell biology, bioinformatics, and beyond. \u201cDo you have an interest in radiochemistry to develop new diagnostic ligands? Are you someone who wants to develop animal models to look at protein transition?\u201d he asks. \u201cWe have a place for you.\u201d", "But the interdisciplinary and \u201ccollaboratory\u201d nature of these projects requires that early-career researchers also \u201cfirm up their soft skills,\u201d says Petanceska. Young investigators working in large consortia who become versed in the various languages of computational biologists, clinicians, or drug discovery experts will be better placed to contribute to projects and eventually lead teams. Friedman agrees that researchers must have strong communications skills. Any scientist should be able to boil down the complexity of their project into why it\u2019s important for funders, investors, other scientists, and the public in a honed elevator pitch.", "\u201cCollaboration has been essential, and it\u2019s going to be even more so,\u201d says Robinson. He advises graduate students and postdocs to practice the art of collaboration early. ", ", Eisai\u2019s executive vice president of human resources and corporate communications in Woodcliff Lake, New Jersey, says that one way to practice collaboration is to have a \u201cbeginner\u2019s mindset\u201d when you are in a meeting. \u201cThat means you focus more on what you don\u2019t know, no matter how much of an expert you are, [and try] to ask questions and be tolerant and respectful when seeking input from others.\u201d", "Similarly, Novartis, recruiters look for emotional resilience in workers.

As happened in recent years, more than 7,500 people responded. About 95% reported working in the biotech and pharma industry, and 80% were age 30 years or older. This year, the proportion of survey respondents from North America increased to 72% from 63% in 2018. The proportion from Europe dropped from 24% to 19%, and the fraction from the Asia/Pacific Rim fell from 9% to 7%.", "Innovation has been a leading driver of top employer status since the survey began in 2002, and this year was no exception. Other reasons for recognition as a top employer were treating employees with respect and having company values that align with theirs. Being socially responsible and having leadership that can make needed changes were also important characteristics of top companies.", "The most noteworthy current and expected changes in the industry, based on open-ended comments from survey respondents, focused on cost-cutting, pressures around drug pricing, and the political environment, including drug regulation policies and changes at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Mergers and acquisitions, outsourcing, and the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) were noted, along with the rising pace of industry research.", "Representatives of some top companies gave their perspectives on these and other issues.

It\u2019s been a year of breakthroughs for the company. In August 2018, Alnylam received the FDA\u2019s first-ever approval for an RNAi therapy. Alnylam\u2019s Onpattro treats neurological symptoms, such as numbness in patients with hereditary transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis. This rare, potentially fatal disease affects about 50,000 people worldwide.", "Maraganore says that having the first RNAi therapy on the market is a clear sign that Alnylam is an innovative leader, which is what survey respondents valued most in a biotech or pharma company. \u201cWe are pioneers in bringing a whole new class of medicines to market,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd before that, we pioneered bringing this technology to clinical trials.\u201d", "Alnylam regularly conducts internal work culture surveys and develops improvement plans based on the results, Maraganore says: \u201cWe view feedback from employees as a big gift, and we harness that to continuously make our company better.\u201d Employees notice innovations in benefits, Maraganore says, for example, an in-house diversity and inclusion team that works on issues such as equity in race, gender identity, and sexual orientation. This initiative aligns with the employee value of social responsibility, consistently rated in the survey as a characteristic of the best companies. Diversity is also a trending issue in the industry. Maraganore just stepped down after two years chairing the Biotechnology Innovation Organization (BIO) Board of Directors. At the last BIO International meeting, BIO launched the Right Mix Matters campaign to provide companies with resources to increase diversity in leadership positions.", "Maraganore also notes employee work\u2013life benefits, such as programs for working at home and for spending time on an exploratory project not directly related to Alnylam R&D. This opportunity can pay off for the company in a big way. \u201cWe recently figured out how to deliver our drugs to the central nervous system, which opens up our pipeline to a range of neurodegenerative diseases,\u201d he says. \u201cThat opportunity happened because we gave a small group of employees the freedom to take 20% of their time to explore a new idea.\u201d", "Drug pricing is at the nexus of a number of topics\u2014including access to medicines, cost-cutting, and politics\u2014that survey takers raised when asked to name notable industry changes. Many companies with groundbreaking but high-cost drugs are developing novel pricing schemes. Maraganore mentions Onpattro pricing related to both innovation and social responsibility, saying that company representatives proactively met with health care payers (insurance companies and other health plan sponsors) to negotiate value-based reimbursement. In these plans, payments made by payers to the company are linked to patient response to drug therapy. \u201cWith other drugs,\u201d he says, \u201cyou pay even if they don\u2019t work.

This strategy is how the company takes advantage of opportunities and innovations, said member of the Executive Board and CEO of Healthcare Bel\u00e9n Garijo. In an email, she said Merck KGaA\u2019s long-term success centers around maintaining connections to all stakeholders, including employees, business leaders, and customers.", "\u00a0(listen to ", "), like Alnylam, celebrates its first year of survey inclusion by entering the survey at No. 5. Like Alnylam, Spark brought a groundbreaking therapy to market in 2018 with the first U.S. commercial sales for a gene therapy product. Luxturna treats vision loss from a rare, inherited retinal dystrophy disease.", "Founded in 2013, Spark is headquartered in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and has more than 400 employees. Katherine High, president and head of R&D, says the company\u2019s innovation is demonstrated by Luxturna and four other gene therapies in clinical trials, with more in the pipeline. High recently talked to an employee with a background in more traditional pharmaceutical work who noted the transformative effect of gene therapy. \u201cA lot of drug programs are just trying to have a narrow margin of superiority over others,\u201d High says. \u201cWith gene therapy, as long as the program is well thought out, we see very clear therapeutic effects.\u201d", "Spark was highly rated by survey participants for having a work culture that aligns with employee values. To describe the company\u2019s culture, High uses the adjective \u201cdynamic.\u201d One employee, she says, noted that \u201cthere\u2019s high speed, there\u2019s warp speed, and there\u2019s \u2018Spark speed.\u2019\u201d Employees see their programs progressing, High explains, and watch their hard work move products from preclinical to clinical stages\u2014and in Luxturna\u2019s case, to commercial success. \u201cAll that is exciting,\u201d she says.", "On the topic of drug pricing, High lists factors that her company considers when setting prices. The diseases for which Spark is developing gene therapies, such as retinal dystrophy, have no available treatments or have high unmet needs. An example of the latter is hemophilia, which requires frequent infusions of clotting factor. A one-time gene therapy intervention could save money over treatments that must be administered over a lifetime and may treat only symptoms, not causes. Pricing also needs to reflect the investments of developing a one-time therapy and should allow a company to be sustainable, High notes.", "To provide patients access to needed therapies, Spark is pursuing several strategies in the United States focused on health care payers, High says. The strategies include installment plans for payments as well as outcome-based rebates derived from the same principles as Alnylam\u2019s value-based reimbursements. For example, if patients don\u2019t achieve expected outcomes based on Phase III clinical trial results, payers are eligible for a rebate from Spark. Because gene therapy is administered at only a few medical centers in the country that have specially trained personnel, agreements with payers ensure that no matter where patients are treated, they pay in-network rates, as though they received care in their home area.", "In another novel approach called \u201cbuy and bill,\u201d payers rather than medical centers purchase the therapy. This plan reduces the financial risks to medical centers\u2014for example, from buying therapies that patients don\u2019t end up using\u2014and eliminates markup costs that payers might otherwise incur. Spark is also looking into installment plans for payments tied to therapy effectiveness, but because of U.S. health care complexities, this requires state-by-state arrangements.", "With regard to survey participants\u2019 comments about mergers and acquisitions, High has direct experience with employee concerns about this situation. Roche is in the process of buying Spark after the boards of both companies unanimously agreed to the acquisition. Employees are positive about the merger, High says. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to see how it unfolds over time, but we see this as an opportunity to access additional financial resources to push our work forward. I personally think it\u2019s exciting,\u201d she adds. \u201cRoche is a world-class drug developer.\u201d", "As was done last year, a white sheet promoting participation in the survey was sent to both public relations and human resources contacts in the biotech and pharma industry from the AAAS database approximately one week prior to launching the online survey.", "This annual web-based survey was conducted from March 5 through April 7, 2019. A mixed methodology was used again to recruit participants for this year's survey. The first part of this methodology included emailed invitations to roughly 50,000 individuals who were located worldwide; these individuals were AAAS members, ", " website registrants, and ", " Careers registrants.

This report is based on a total sample of approximately 7,650 completed surveys; 97% of these surveys were a result of the email campaign to HR contacts and advertising agencies while 3% were from the end-user campaign and social media efforts.", "The acquisition would add Spark to the Roche group, which includes ", ", this year at No. 8 in the survey. Founded in 1976, with headquarters in South San Francisco, the well-established Genentech is a contrast to Spark. While this is Spark\u2019s first year in the survey, Genentech is the only company to have been one of the top employers since the survey started in 2002, setting the standard for the entire field.", "While the term \u201cspeed\u201d (along with \u201cwell thought out\u201d) comes up in High\u2019s description of the Spark culture, Mike Varney, Genentech\u2019s executive vice president of research and early development, uses the word \u201cpatience\u201d to describe his company\u2019s scientific approach. The Roche group has room for both Spark and Genentech, however, because of a common overall culture. \u201cWe all value rigorous science,\u201d Varney says, \u201cbut Genentech and others in the Roche group maintain their own subculture. We build the organization the way we want and create the kind of work culture that will facilitate our innovation.\u201d", "Genentech maintains its status as an innovative leader by harnessing technology to deeply understand the biology of disease, Varney says. Initially, the company\u2019s founders used this principle to translate the technology of gene cloning into medicines such as hormones. Later, company researchers focused on converting the specificity and binding affinity of antibodies into immuno-oncology therapies.\u00a0", "\u201cThis business requires understanding complex biology,\u201d Varney says, \u201cso patience is a virtue and persistence is a huge component of success. We\u2019re willing to put the time and resources into solving problems.\u201d He notes that distinguishing features of the company are its high ratio of discovery biologists to other employees and the commitment of its researchers to use data to guide their projects.", "Varney agrees with survey participants about the increasing pace required to move products through pipelines. \u201cThere\u2019s no question that time matters,\u201d he says, but emphasizes that the company\u2019s approach is efficient and strategic in the end. Researchers don\u2019t waste time pursuing medicines that their data do not support, but when their findings show promise, they continue. This is one reason so many of Genentech\u2019s products are first-in-class therapies, Varney observes. \u201cWe believe in our biology so strongly that we stay in the game when others drop out.\u201d An example, he says, is that company persistence resulted in their AKT (protein kinase B) inhibitor, now in clinical trials for cancer therapy.", "One of Genentech\u2019s strengths in the survey was quality research with talented employees. An experiment-focused company attracts action-oriented people interested in exploring the unknown, Varney says. \u201cThere\u2019s no innovation without experimentation. In an innovative environment, you take action,\u201d he says. \u201cIn a noninnovative environment, you analyze.\u201d Genentech has long had programs that encourage researchers to explore avenues not always directly related to their company work. Currently, research leaders can apply for internal innovation funds or for a postdoc to work on an industry or academic project.", "In the midst of a general emphasis on multidisciplinary teams and flat structures, Genentech also holds to a single decision-maker model for its research teams. \u201cYou can have a freewheeling team with freedom to explore,\u201d Varney says, \u201cbut someone has to make the decisions and point the team members in the same direction.\u201d The decision-maker\u2019s goal is to choose based on data and input from the team. This model, Varney says, \u201cprovides organizational clarity.\u201d", "At No. 9 this year was ", ", moving up from No. 16 in 2018. The company is headquartered in Indianapolis, Indiana, but has a presence around the world. In an email, Terri Grant, vice president for human resources at Lilly Research Laboratories and Lilly Oncology, noted several factors that are attractive to employees. These include a focus on transformational medicines and a collaborative approach involving scientists, physicians, academic researchers, and contributors from health care organizations. Like Alnylam, Lilly is also responding to employee feedback by working to increase diversity, including in management and leadership positions.", "A strength of Lilly compared to companies with similar rankings in the survey is social responsibility. Grant points to two programs that make the company stand out in this area. On Lilly\u2019s annual Global Day of Service, employees volunteer in their communities. Also, the company\u2019s Connecting Hearts Abroad program sends about 100 employees a year on a two-week volunteer service assignment, for example to South Africa or Mexico. Participants help with health-related issues ranging from diabetes care to mobile community health screenings, gaining inspiration and experience that enhance their sense of purpose as employees.", "\u00a0(listen to ", "), an agriculture company headquartered in Basel, Switzerland, was No. 10 this year, moving up from No. 14 in 2018. Gusui Wu, head of seeds research, has been with the company for only a year, but says a reason for the rise in employer standing might be that after a period of change (including acquisition by ChemChina in 2017), Syngenta now has a clearer vision for the future. Both leadership and employees see a more definable role for Syngenta in the industry and in how it contributes to society. \u201cOur industry is historically not seen as sustainable, but we have a vital role in food security,\u201d Wu says, \u201cso there\u2019s now more emphasis on agricultural sustainability and meeting the challenge of climate change.\u201d", "In fact, a strength of Syngenta relative to companies with similar rankings is corporate responsibility. Wu observes that company goals of helping feed the world while protecting the planet through sustainable agriculture align with employees\u2019 personal values. By working on products that help farmers address issues such as drought, changes in crop pests, and diseases that arise from the climate crisis, he says, \u201cour scientists feel they\u2019re doing good by coming to work every day.\u201d", "According to Wu, Syngenta is in a unique position to help developing economies by lifting their agricultural productivity\u2014for example, with products for insect and disease control. Syngenta research sites, corporate offices, and production plants are held to sustainability and environmental health standards with periodic audits, which may be another responsible action noticed by employees.", "Syngenta has made recent outreach efforts to the public and especially customers. \u201cWe believe people have misperceptions about what we do,\u201d Wu says. To be clearer about the benefits of agricultural technology, this year Syngenta conducted a 90-day initiative consisting of listening sessions with, for example, consumers and farmer groups. One result was a long-term partnership with The Nature Conservancy, which got positive feedback from employees. Another initiative, focusing on soil health, aims to develop technologies that reduce nutrient loss in soil.", "Earlier this year, Syngenta began a project to facilitate R&D collaborations with farms, which has connected more than 100 Syngenta scientists with large agricultural operations, Wu says. The project\u2019s goals are sharing data, demonstrating technology, and collecting information on product performance. \u201cFarmers get to see the technology we\u2019re working on,\u201d he explains, \u201cand scientists get direct input and feedback from farmers who will be using our products.\u201d Also, like Alnylam, Genentech, and other companies, Syngenta has a competitive internal funding program for researchers to explore high-risk, high-return, creative projects separate from their product-development work.", "Since agrobusiness is going through a period of consolidation, Wu has insights about employee management during mergers and acquisitions. The 2017 acquisition of Syngenta by ChemChina was for the purpose of expansion and growth, and to help China increase agricultural productivity, he says, not for cost-cutting and reductions. Still, when two companies come together, regardless of the reason, processes, procedures, and cultures will change. Recognizing the inevitable disruption that Syngenta faced, the company instituted change management programs so employees understood the business rationale for the acquisition and what it meant to them. \u201cThe worst situation is leaving employees and the organization in uncertainty,\u201d Wu says. \u201cThe ambiguity can be unsettling.\u201d", "Communication is critical; it\u2019s especially important to ensure that employees hear frequently from corporate leaders and their own supervisors, Wu says. \u201cEven if we don\u2019t have answers, we explain that we\u2019re trying to get clarity on questions. We report progress and keep employees as informed as possible.\u201d", "In addition to pressures related to drug pricing and mergers and acquisitions, survey participants consistently note industry changes, including the rising use of automation, AI, and machine learning (ML) in research. At Alnylam, for example, Maraganore says AI and ML are enhancing effectiveness in multiple ways, from identifying sequences for designing RNAi drugs to locating patients who might benefit from Onpattro.", "At Merck KGaA, Garijo says AI tools are expected to increase efficiency and effectiveness. The company has several AI-related agreements, including with AI drug-design company Iktos and proteome-screening company Cyclica. Merck KGaA also received a U.S. patent for a system that uses AI to protect supply-chain integrity. The system links physical objects, such as equipment parts or pills, with digital signatures that are securely stored with blockchain technology. This process ensures the authenticity of medicines but could also be used for products such as food and electronic devices, Garijo explains.", "AI tools fit the Genentech commitment to understanding the biology behind diseases, says Varney. He sees drug discovery as a sorting exercise, narrowing targets and candidates from a large pool down to the most promising. The company integrates data scientists within research teams to apply AI where it can make sorting more efficient. One example is an application that rejects small-molecule drug candidates when data indicate they are likely to be quickly metabolized. Another applies data to identify tumor-associated proteins that will be antigenic and easily displayed to the immune system for personalized cancer vaccines. By making sorting more efficient, \u201cAI frees up scientists\u2019 time so they can think and be creative and do other work that machines can\u2019t do,\u201d Varney says.", ", headquartered in Brentford, United Kingdom and at No. 16 this year, has long been a leader in AI and ML. GSK has used AI for traditional R&D, such as small-molecule drug discovery. Recently, the global pharmaceutical company stepped up its AI\u2013ML game (", ").", "In 2018, Hal Barron became GSK\u2019s chief scientific officer and president of R&D. He is directing new investments in R&D, particularly in immunology, human genetics, and advanced technologies. GSK is focusing its technology development on the intersection of human genetics data, functional genomics, and AI and ML to help understand human disease on a cellular level. Barron explains two points driving GSK R&D: (1) Less than 10% of drugs that enter clinical testing go to market, and (2) genetic validation increases the likelihood a medicine will succeed. This is why GSK developed partnerships with human genetics organizations such as 23andMe and Open Targets to use data to help identify new drug targets.", "To validate targets, GSK plans to incorporate CRISPR gene-editing technology for functional genomics through a partnership with the University of California. Researchers will use CRISPR to test how altering candidate genes or their expression affects human cells in vitro. Functional genomics generates \u201ctrillions of datapoints,\u201d Barron says, so ML is essential for the next step\u2014integrating the data and helping to understand relationships between genes and how mutations relate to disease. To support this work, GSK is building infrastructure, including an in-house data science group, a platform for integrating large datasets, and automated tools for data analysis. Barron expects these innovations to increase R&D speed from discovery to clinical trials to market.", "The addition of AI and ML to drug development and marketing is speeding breakthroughs across the industry. More mergers, acquisitions, and consolidations are expected by survey participants, who also noted Brexit and upcoming U.S. elections as changes expected to affect the industry.\u00a0", "The bottom line for pharma and biotech companies, however, is that employees need to feel that their company supports them in doing high-quality, rigorous, impactful work, Maraganore notes. \u201cI believe our employees are invigorated to work for a company that is bringing innovative medicine to patients,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019re generating something brand-new and transformative, which creates a sense of pride and a sense of purpose.\u201d \u00a0", "Enter keywords, locations or job types to start searching for your new science career.", "\n  Vol 366,\n\n      Issue 6469  ", "\u00a9 2019\u00a0", ".

But 3 months after our youngest daughter Marie was born, she started to have seizures. After a terrifying ambulance ride and a nerve-wracking week in a children\u2019s hospital, Marie was diagnosed with ring chromosome 14 syndrome, an exceedingly rare and debilitating condition caused when the 14th chromosome is fused into a ring. Life for our family was about to switch tracks, and we were along for the ride but no longer in control.", "Working Life is a personal essay series about career issues, challenges, and successes.", "Marie\u2019s seizures had no regard for class schedules or family time. We tried to keep up with our teaching duties, but it was difficult to lecture knowing that our young daughter could have a life-threatening seizure at any moment. Neither of us wanted to give up our academic career\u2014and we didn\u2019t want the other to have to, either. But rigid teaching schedules proved untenable, especially when coupled with the other stresses of academic life, and we needed more flexibility.", "The reality was that Andrew was tenured, with the associated job security, and Yssa had applied mathematics expertise that made her more marketable outside academia. After discussing our options, we decided that Yssa would forgo her academic appointment. She obtained a part-time research position in industry, which required fewer hours for equivalent pay and allowed her to work from home when needed. She also started a nonprofit organization for families and researchers interested in ring 14. Our lives were still complicated\u2014including multiple therapy sessions each week plus specialized, expensive child care\u2014but it seemed we had found a way forward.", "We made this arrangement work for many years. But as our older daughters approached college age, we needed to re-evaluate our situation again. They had matured into fantastic caregivers, and their departure would have a huge impact on their sister and on us. Marie\u2019s seizures continued unabated, she was hospitalized regularly, and new concerns were looming as she approached adolescence. Facing numerous surgeries and complex long-term care, we struggled to achieve the elusive work-life balance and needed more support than well-meaning friends could offer.", "So, 5 years ago, we moved from Indiana to our native Texas, where most of our extended family resides. We developed a plan to sell the move to Andrew\u2019s department head and dean: He\u2019d take a 1-year sabbatical at 50% pay while spending the other half of his time working in an unrelated family business. That way we could give an in absentia appointment a try.", "When Marie was born our smooth, straight ride ... turned into a roller coaster.", "The administrators were understandably skeptical at first, but they agreed to a trial run. The first year of Andrew\u2019s \u201csabbatical\u201d ultimately proved successful, so he resigned from the family business and returned full-time to his faculty role\u2014buoyed by the support of empathetic students, colleagues, and administrators. He spends about 1 week per month on campus and continues to teach, maintain a research lab, and serve on myriad committees. It\u2019s often difficult, as Andrew sometimes struggles to arrange online access to meetings and he misses having colleagues down the hall. But so far it has been tenable.", "By helping us find a better work-life balance, the arrangement has also allowed Yssa to continue her work, which is now fully focused on running national and international ring 14 nonprofits. Yssa misses many aspects of her prior professional life, most of all the students. However, she finds intellectual stimulation and reward in working with parents and physicians to push medicine forward and help families become their own advocates.", "When Marie was born our smooth, straight ride unexpectedly turned into a roller coaster, with many joys but also with some poignant regrets.

My co-authors were also interested in these issues, so we teamed up to look at the diversity of past speakers.", " We found that compared with our department\u2019s population of postdocs and students, the speakers were disproportionately white and male. Our department has slightly more women trainees than men, and the invited speakers were about 40% women.

Using all that information, he was able to devise a response that wouldn\u2019t alienate anyone in the lab, and the students were accepting of the changes because they could see how their input was used.\u00a0", "In other instances, it might be best to have an all-hands-on-deck meeting. Jay took that approach recently, holding a lab meeting to craft a work-life balance policy. It quickly became evident that there were many different perspectives in the lab on what such a policy might entail. Some people wanted immediate responses to their emails, and others wanted to unplug during evenings and weekends. By voicing all these concerns collectively, the lab was able to hear those perspectives and develop a set of policies that aimed to meet everyone\u2019s needs. This might have been harder to accomplish with a series of one-on-one meetings.", "It is important to remember that a culture of openness can be harder to cultivate than it seems\u2014but it is essential for ", ". Because of inherent power structures, it will almost always be easier for the PI to speak more freely than students. Whenever possible, make it clear that open conversation is welcome and be consistent in taking feedback seriously. If you react badly or criticize students for expressing different opinions, your trainees will eventually stop coming to you with issues or might lean on others to address their concerns. But if you act professionally, express empathy, and work with your students to resolve their concerns, they\u2019ll be more likely to trust you and be open and honest in the future.", "If there is a major conflict in the research group, intervention is obviously important. But sometimes small conflicts are natural and healthy, and it\u2019s important to be able to assess the severity of the situation and figure out when intervention is needed\u2014and when it\u2019s not. Students can often work things out between themselves and might resent micromanagement. It\u2019s also OK at times to let your mentees rely on one another for emotional support.", "Likewise, when a student is upset with their adviser there is a natural process of blowing off steam. In these cases, confronting them might backfire or make matters worse. You are not going to be seen as \u201cthe world's best boss\u201d all the time. You will have to give honest feedback on occasion that will help your trainees in the long term, even if it may not feel good in the short term. If they don\u2019t react in the way you expect, try not to take it personally and don\u2019t overreact to every slight.", "Once you are sure that an issue is worth acting on, take steps to immediately develop a plan to address the problem before it escalates. Structural conflicts rarely get resolved on their own, and a small conflict that stems from a real correctable problem can turn into a large one if unaddressed, especially if there is a perception that the PI doesn\u2019t care about the situation. If confidentiality can be maintained, it may be useful to speak with other, more senior, faculty about the situation to get their perspective.\u00a0", "If the conflict is severe, you should make a point of documenting the issue (e.g., by collecting evidence of the problem, saving relevant emails). Then, find out who you need to contact at your university and what you need to report. In some cases, you may be ethically or legally required to report the issue to the relevant authorities (e.g., Title IX office, funding agency). Know your rights and responsibilities and act accordingly.", "When you\u2019re dealing with conflict, it\u2019s important to be able to look inward\u2014to critically evaluate yourself\u2014and be open to change. You may have laid out a set of lab policies and procedures that work well for you. But, as Jay\u2019s work-life balance example demonstrates, not everyone operates the same way. And a great lab is one that optimizes the conditions of success for everyone.", "You may want to give autonomy to your students because that\u2019s what you would have wanted, but some students may feel as though they\u2019ve been abandoned. Conversely, if you opt to help guide students through the research process in a hands-on way, some of them may experience that as micromanagement. If you listen carefully and have an open dialogue with your students, you will understand their needs and preferences, and you will be able to customize your mentoring style accordingly.", "You may only need to make small adjustments to prevent future conflicts around the same issue. But if problems are serious enough, you may need to generate a new set of lab norms and expectations. Ask your trainees and colleagues for advice to see if you can find a solution. We have all received indispensable advice from others just by opening up about the challenges we are facing.", "Conflict is not necessarily a bad thing in the development of a lab; it often inspires a new and better way of working. Try to channel the feedback you get from trainees into building a stronger and better functioning research group. Lab members may come away feeling validated and understood, with a greater capacity for open dialogue and trust.

Moreover, 32% reported at least four symptoms, indicating a risk for common psychiatric disorders, which was more than twice the prevalence among highly educated comparison groups. The most commonly reported symptoms included feeling under constant strain, being unhappy and depressed, losing sleep because of worry, and not being able to overcome difficulties or enjoy day-to-day activities. The greatest predictor for experiencing mental health challenges was having difficulty taking care of family needs due to conflicting work commitments. High job demands and low job control were also associated with increased symptoms.", "On the plus side, having an inspirational supervisor partially offset these risks. So did interest in an academic career, even among students who thought they had little chance of ultimately making it. Seeing a Ph.D. as good preparation for a nonacademic career and an added value for employers was also beneficial. \u201cWhen people have a clear vision of the future and the path that they are taking, this provides a sense of meaningfulness, progress and control, which should be a protective factor against mental health problems,\u201d the authors explain.", "According to Nathan Vanderford, an assistant dean for academic development at the University of Kentucky in Lexington who also ", ", \u201c[t]he study underscores what has long been presumed; that work conditions and career outlook plays a key role in the mental state of PhD trainees,\u201d he writes in an email to ", " Careers.", "\u201c[I]nstitutions, departments and PIs have long ignored the systemic mental health issues among PhD trainees,\u201d Vanderford continues. \u201cData such as this should make the issues irrefutable and should, for ethical and moral reasons, force the hand of these entities to take on the responsibility of helping to provide PhD trainees with the support they need to navigate the very stressful journey of earning a PhD.\u201d Levecque and Anseel point out that small steps such as facilitating work-life balance or \u201coffering PhD students clear and full information on job expectations and career prospects, both in and outside academia,\u201d could have a significant positive impact.", "One message for PIs is that \u201cinvesting in their own leadership competencies could really make a difference\u201d for Ph.D. students, the authors add. They encourage PIs to take the issue seriously and learn how to spot signs of potential emotional distress. Gail Kinman, a professor at the University of Bedfordshire in the United Kingdom who acted as a reviewer for the paper, agrees. \u201cPIs should look out for students who isolate themselves, who seem anxious and withdrawn, who are not meeting deadlines.
